## Suicide Markers Around the World

The aim of this project was to get a better grasp on many of the features within Excel and learn more on the suicide epidemic around the world.  

Data for the project came a Kaggle dataset that linked data from a few sources including the WHO, World Bank, and United Nations.

Some key facts from the World Health Organization:  
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide  
- More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year.
- For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population.
- Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds.
- 77% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.
- Ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally.

Below is the dynamic dashboard that I created based on some newly learned design concepts to explore suicide rates around the world.  
Feel free to download the `suicides.xlsx` file to interact with the dashboard.
